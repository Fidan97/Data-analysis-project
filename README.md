My project related to data analysis.
# 1.Transctions project
The transaction dataset contains information about individual financial transactions, including amounts, dates, and associated attributes. It can be used to analyze trends, seasonality, and patterns in transaction behavior over time. This data is suitable for time series forecasting, such as predicting future transaction amounts using ARIMA or other models. It also helps identify periods of high or low financial activity.
